                    AB Cover Designers did my chairs and linens for my wedding and they were fantastic.
                    They were great with helping me choose the right colors for the linens and the right color chairs. Their prices are fair. Yes, they are a little more expensive than a couple of the other places I checked out, but the quality and service you get with them is totally worth it.
                    Ana and great to work with. She's got great eye for what she does, and she's fun to work with.

                    I rented all my chairs, linens and charger plates from Them. We have known Gilberto the owner, and Betsy who runs the showroom, for a long time since my mom worked in the wedding industry. 
                    They have a beautiful selection, their prices are fair and they work flawlessly to meet your needs! 
                    They have excellent taste and Betsy Will help you choose amazing linen combos to compliment your wedding style!
